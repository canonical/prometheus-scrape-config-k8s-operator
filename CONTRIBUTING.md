# Prometheus Scrape Config Operator

## Developing

Create and activate a virtualenv with the development requirements:

```sh
virtualenv -p python3 venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Testing

The Python operator framework includes a very nice harness for testing
operator behaviour without full deployment.
